		<h2>
			How this thing works
		</h2>
		<p>
			Hi there! I see you have found THE DERPINATOR. Here's how to "use" it:
		</p>
		<p>
			It's simple: write a story in the text area here. For all words that you want derped, professional term btw [citation needed], write derp:[word type] instead. Like I said, simple!
		</p>
		<p>
			Supported word types are:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Noun</li>
			<li>Person</li>
			<li>Object</li>
			<li>Adjective</li>
			<li>Verb</li>
			<li>Adverb</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Noun/person/object are a bit special, as they are all nouns. In my benevolence I just wanted to give you a way to specify if the thing should be "alive" or not. If you say "noun", you'll get either an "object" or a "person".
		</p>
		<p>
			Verbs are all past tense. Adverbs are descriptive words that mostly end in "-ly", and adjectives are descriptive words that... well, don't. You put adjectives in front of nouns, and adverbs in front of verbs.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Mutations
		</h3>
		<p>
			THE DERPINATOR will attempt to pluralize words if it feels like it. A/an should be taken care of, but your careful capitalization at the start of sentences will be wholly ignored if it's an article.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>IMPROTANT: Verbs are past-tense.</strong> Yup, all of them. And they don't mutate. So write your thing like a fairy tale. "There once was a derp:person, who derp:verb another derp:person". You get the point.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Consistency
		</h3>
		<p>
			Although maybe counter-intuitive given what kind of thing this is, you can have a consistent derp in your story! The derp will be randomized the first time, but then it remembers what it chose. How to use this? Glad you asked.
		</p>
		<p>
			Just put [a number] after the derp:whatever. Like this: "The derp:person[1] was very derp:adjective[2] derp:noun[3]. The derp:person[1] liked being very derp:adjective[2] derp:noun[3]." Then, all derps with the same [number] will be the same throughout your derp. Useful? Kinda! Fun? Maybe? A good use of my programming time? You betcha!
		</p>
		<h3>
			Saving
		</h3>
		<p>
			So, you made a funny derp? Maybe you want to save it, to remember your great achievement? Just hit the "Ooh, good one! Save it!" button, and the derp will be listed here until the end of time (or until you clear your browser cache). A way more stable way to save your derp would be to copy and paste into a text document, but I think we already established that I like to waste my programming time.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you want to make sure your amazing derp-base is saved over BSOD's, hit the "set as default derp-base"-button. Now, every time you come back, the text that was in the textarea when you hit the button will be there. Cool right? :D ... no??
		</p>
		<h3>
			DISCLAIMER!
		</h3>
		<p>
			None of the randomized are guaranteed to be grammatically correct or suit your sentence. I am not responsible for upsetting your exquisite grammatical acumen. Usage of THE DERPINATOR is fully optional for anyone with free will (check with your local government if you don't have free will), and in fact, I do not encourage it at all. The one guarantee I can give is that grammatical rules will not be followed if not unavoidable.
